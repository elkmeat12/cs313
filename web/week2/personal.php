            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
               My name is Tyler Elkington and I am from Idaho Falls. I served my mission in Iloilo, Philippines where I learned
               up to 6 dialects (although many of them being similar). I returned home in 2016 and first attended school at 
               Dixie State University. It was there where I met my wife. We have been married for two years and are expecting 
               to have a baby boy in May. We both plan to graduate this April, but I am still looking for an internship. 
               Some of my hobbies include fishing, hiking, and being in the outdoors. I love taking pictures of scenery. 
               My major is Computer Science, but I have found a passion for UX research.
